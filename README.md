This is a web app that I made for the scandi web test
It's built mainly using react js (for fronted )and php (for the back end.)
Most of the logic is in the react js and then information is sent using axios to the backend where data is
Sent or received from a phpmyadmin mysql database. 
The php file is mainly used as an api
